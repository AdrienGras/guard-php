A tiny PHP library bringing the **`guard`** concept (inspired by Kotlin, Swift, Dart‚Ä¶) to PHP.  
Available globally via Composer ‚Äî works in **plain PHP, Symfony, and Laravel**.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- **Global `guard()` function** available everywhere
- Throws an exception if a condition is not met
- Supports:
  - Simple error message
  - Existing exception instance
  - Lazy exception factory (`callable`)
- **Caller blame** mode: the error is shown as if it occurred where `guard()` was called, not inside the package
- PHP **8.1+** compatible
- Zero runtime dependencies

## ‚ùì Why this package?

Defensive programming is a key practice to make your code more reliable and easier to debug.  
Languages like **Kotlin** and **Swift** provide a native `guard` statement to quickly validate assumptions and fail fast when something is wrong.

In PHP, similar checks often look like this:

```php
if ($price < 0) {
    throw new InvalidArgumentException('Price must be non-negative');
}
```

This package brings a **concise, expressive, and consistent way** to write those checks:

```php
guard($price >= 0, 'Price must be non-negative');
```

Benefits:

- **Readability** ‚Äì One-line, expressive intent
- **Consistency** ‚Äì Same syntax across all projects and frameworks
- **Less boilerplate** ‚Äì No repetitive if + throw blocks
- **Framework-agnostic** ‚Äì Works in plain PHP, Symfony, Laravel‚Ä¶

## ‚öôÔ∏è How it works ‚Äî Caller blame mode

By default, guard() is in caller **blame mode** (`$blameCaller = true`):

- It scans the **debug backtrace** to find the first frame **outside** `vendor/` and outside the `guard.php` file itself.
- It then _tries_ to rewrite the `$file` and `$line` properties of the exception via `ReflectionProperty` so the error appears to originate from your code.
- If PHP forbids modifying these properties (some runtimes mark them internally as readonly), `guard()` falls back to **wrapping** the original exception in an `ErrorException`:
  - The new exception has `file` and `line` set to the caller‚Äôs location
  - The original exception is preserved as `$previous`

Example ‚Äî without blame:

```txt
In vendor/your-vendor/guard-php/src/functions.php line 47:
Price must be non-negative
```

Example ‚Äî with blame (default):

```txt
In src/Service/CheckoutService.php line 123:
Price must be non-negative
```

You can disable caller blame explicitly:

```php
guard($condition, 'message', null, null, false);
```

## üì¶ Installation

```bash
composer require adriengras/guard-php
```

> The global function is automatically loaded via autoload.files ‚Äî no extra configuration needed.

## üöÄ Usage

### Basic example

```php
guard($price >= 0, 'Price must be non-negative');
```

### With a custom exception

```php
guard($user !== null, new DomainException('User not found'));
```

### Lazy exception (callable)

```php
guard($stock >= $qty, fn() => new OutOfRangeException("Not enough stock for SKU {$sku}"));
```

## üß© Framework compatibility

- **Symfony** ‚Äì works out-of-the-box in controllers, services, commands‚Ä¶
- **Laravel** ‚Äì works directly in controllers, jobs, events‚Ä¶
- **Plain PHP** ‚Äì just require 'vendor/autoload.php';
